# Gridfinity Generator

A web-based gridfinity generator that creates parametric models using
gfthings, build123d and WebAssembly. Generate STL files and view them in
your browser!

## Thanks

This is based on https://github.com/Radther/build123dWebAssmGenDemo using
that demo as a template/base for this project.  It is powered by
https://github.com/PaulBone/gfthings which is built using
https://github.com/gumyr/build123d.

I'd like to acknowledge the help of the build123d folks for providing a
template, experiments and such.

## Usage

1. **Visit the site** http://gfthings.bone.id.au

That's the only step!  Well, except for the other steps:

2. **Wait for loading**

3. **Choose options and parameters** the options on the left allow you
   to customise your bin.

4. **Click generate** to create and view your 3D model, there will be a
   small delay.

5. **Inspect the result** and download the file, or go back to step 3.
